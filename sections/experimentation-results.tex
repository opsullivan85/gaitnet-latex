\section{Experimentation and Results}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\begin{outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation: NVIDIA Isaac Lab with parallel GPU simulation for learning and CPU-based MPC for control.
    \item Terrain: Infinite strip of terrain varying in difficulty (void density \expLowestDifficulty{}-\expHighestDifficulty{}) and commanded velocity.
\end{itemize}
\end{outline}

\subsection{Qualitative Performance}
\begin{outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acyclic Behavior: GaitNet generates non-periodic gaits. At high speeds, it executes simultaneous steps (up to two legs in swing), adapting dynamically without pre-defined phase offsets.
    \item Swing Duration: The network learns to modulate swing duration, favoring 0.22-0.25s for stability but utilizing faster steps (0.125s) for recovery.
\end{itemize}
\end{outline}

\subsection{Baseline Comparison}
\begin{outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Baseline: A single-leg motion planner (similar to ContactNet without the GaitNet selector).
    \item GaitNet achieves a 69.4\% mean survival rate vs. 25.6\% for the baseline
    \item GaitNet maintains performance at higher velocities (>0.15m/s) where the baseline fails.
\end{itemize}
