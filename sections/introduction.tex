\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
\begin{outline}
    Legged robots need to traverse uneven, unstructured terrains (disaster zones, rocky landscapes) where periodic gaits are insufficient.
\end{outline}

\subsection{Related Work}
\begin{outline}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimization-based Planning: Discusses mixed-integer programming and MCTS methods, noting their high computational cost.
    \item Hybrid Architectures: Reviews methods separating high-level planning (RL) from low-level control (MPC).
    \item Learning-based Footstep Planners: Contrast with ContactNet and DeepLoco, emphasizing GaitNet's ability to handle multi-leg, non-gaited motion.
    \item Limitations of Prior Work...
\end{itemize}
\end{outline}

\subsection{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel greedy footstep planner (GaitNet) that ranks discrete candidates for continuous execution.
    \item A hierarchical architecture combining supervised learning for cost estimation and PPO for gait selection.
    \item Empirical evidence that removing pre-computed heuristic costs improves policy performance (\resBestSurvivalRate{} survival)
\end{itemize}
